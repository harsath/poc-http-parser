### Plain-Old-C HTTP parser
![Linux Actions Status](https://github.com/harsath/poc-http-parser/workflows/Linux/badge.svg)

Originally implemented for my internal use to play around with Linux and FreeBSD's networking interface for event-driven
APIs, but I find myself using it ofter.
It's a header-only C HTTP parser. You can just plug-in anywhere.
It's under very active development. Once done, I will write some tests(and possiable benchmarks).
