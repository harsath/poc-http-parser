### Plain-Old-C HTTP State-Machine parser
Originally implemented for my internal use to play around with Linux and FreeBSD's networking interface for event-driven
APIs, but I find myself using it ofter.
It's a header-only C state-machine HTTP parser. You can just plug-in anywhere.
It's under very active development. Once done, I will write some tests(and possiable benchmarks).
